## Introduction

- Multivariate time series forecasting is an important problem
- Few-shot learning is a promising approach to solve this problem
- In this work, we propose a few-shot learning approach for multivariate time series forecasting

---

## Problem formulation

- Given a set of multivariate time series
- Predict future values of the time series
- Given only a few samples of the time series

---

## Approach

- We propose a few-shot learning approach based on Siamese neural networks
- The network takes in two time series as input
- It outputs a similarity score between the two time series
- We train the network to maximize the similarity score between time series that are close in the input space

---

## Results

- Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets
- We demonstrate that our approach is able to generalize to unseen datasets
- We show that our approach is able to learn meaningful representations of the time series

---

## Conclusion

- We proposed a few-shot learning approach for multivariate time series forecasting
- Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets
- Our approach is able to generalize to unseen datasets and learn meaningful representations of the time series
